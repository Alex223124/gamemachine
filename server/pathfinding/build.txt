
First you need to clone recastnavigation into the pathfinding folder.

There are premake4 binaries for linux and windows in the premake folder.

Run one of the premake binaries with the options for your OS.  This should give you a build folder.  For windows open the sln and build.  For linux cd to the build folder and type 'make'.

The linux build will copy the libraries to the bin folder which is where game machine expects to find them.  On windows you will need to copy them there manually.

pathfinding.cs is a wrapper around the dll for windows that can be used in Unity (or any C# game engine).  Note that the query methods have coordinate mappings where we swap x and z.  This is so it works correctly with our own obj export. Feel free to change that if needed.  This is the C# code, native code always uses recast coordinates.

The dll provides simple functionality for loading navigation meshes and performing pathfinding queries.  pathfinding.cs is a good reference for how to use it.  

In ruby the Navigation module has several classes for working with navigation meshes and doing queries.  It uses the ruby FFI to call the library.

Also, the Unity client has an ExportScene.cs editor file for exporting terrains + other geometries to a single obj file that recastdemo can create a navmesh from.
