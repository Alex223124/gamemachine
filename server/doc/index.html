<h1 id="label-Game+Machine">Game Machine</h1>

<p>Game Machine is a highly performant, scalable massive multiplayer game
engine written in
<a href="http://www.jruby.org">Jruby</a>.
It is based on
<a href="http://www.akka.io">Akka</a>, an actor based messaging
system
built on the JVM. Game machine makes it simple to write performant,
scalable
code using higher level abstractions.</p>

<h1 id="label-Features">Features</h1>

</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Installation">Installation</h1>

<p>Install the gem
&lt;code&gt;ruby
gem install game_machine
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>Create a new game
&lt;code&gt;ruby
game_machine --new
/tmp/mygame
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>Compile the java libraries and protocol buffer
messages
&lt;code&gt;ruby
rake java:all
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>Set the game to boot into the demo
&lt;code&gt;ruby
rake
game:demo
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>Start the server
&lt;code&gt;ruby
game_machine --name=seed01
--server
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>This will give you a server running the demo game.</p>

<p>The demo game spawns 2000 npc&#39;s in the world.
Npc&#39;s within range
will appear and chase you. Npc&#39;s will attack you and do
damage, but
this is not yet reflected in the client.</p>

<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/chrisochs/gm_unity_client">Unity3d demo
client</a>.
You need to have unity installed until I get a build out that
lets you enter
the ip of the server.</p>

<p>In the client go into GameClient.cs and on line 74 change the ip to
your
server&#39;s ip. Now you can run the client and run around the world.
I can
usually get up to 200 npc&#39;s following me before the rendering
drops the
framerate to around 2-5. Note that the demo does no smoothing of
npc movement
client side. This is to accurately show the amount of lag and
how well the
server keeps up even with large numbers of objects.</p>

<p>To run a 2 server cluster just run the same command but pass it seed02 as
the
name. Running a 2 server cluster will result in the world having 4000
npc&#39;s,
with the processing evenly distributed across both servers.</p>

<h1 id="label-Performance">Performance</h1>

<p>My goal is to have all the core game systems scale out well within the
context
of a single virtual world, using homogenized servers, to at least
100,000
concurrent players/npc&#39;s.</p>

<p>A secondary goal is to support large numbers of players within the
same
vacinity. This is mostly an issue of optimizing client bandwidth.
Currently
a single server can handle a few thousand concurrent players and
npc&#39;s in the same
area, but the client reaches a point where it&#39;s
just too much data.</p>

<p>The basic approach I have taken is to stick in ruby until benchmarking
shows
that we need to move the functionality to java. The spatial grid is a
good
example of something that gained a lot by writing it in java.</p>

<p>Lots of work has gone into the entity tracking system and spatial grid. On
a
vmware instance running inside a quad core I5, I&#39;m able to run up to
10,000 npc
controllers at once with 200% cpu utilization. Each
controller&#39;s update method
runs 10 times a second, doing a neighbor
search, movement, and combat at each
update.</p>

<p>A more reasonable number with 2000 npc&#39;s sticks at around 30% cpu.</p>

<p>With the same setup the object persistence was able to handle pretty
much
anything you could throw at it. The write behind cache is tunable so
that
effects performance quite a bit. Testing just the peristence layer I
was
getting around 20,000 writes per second on a 2 machine cluster with
couchbase
as the backend store. Performance depends a lot on the
configuration of the
write behind cache.</p>

<p>More work needs to go into optimizing client bandwidth, specifically data
sent
to the client as a result of neighbor queries. The server sends
integers
instead of floats, and everything is bit packed by default
(protocol buffers
gives you this for free). The next step is to explore
sending local cell
coordinates only, or possibly use polar coordinates.</p>

<p>The client messaging pipeline will need more work. We need a better
testing
framework for large numbers of clients. I&#39;ve done some minimal
testing to know
that we don&#39;t have significant bugs under reasonable
client loads (+-2000
connections per server).</p>
