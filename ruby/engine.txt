
Game engine architecture

- engine = routers + app servers
- app servers run handlers + persistence layer
- router receives messages from client
- routes to handler
- handler returns response to router, router to client

- users tied to specific app servers.  Can be migrated to other app servers
- handler runs in thread.  Configurable thread pool
